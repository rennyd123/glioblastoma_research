### Difference in Gender?

ggsurvfit(km) + 
  add_pvalue("annotation", size = 5) + 
  labs(
    x = "Time (Months)",
    title = "Overall Survival of All Patients Treatment by Gender"
    )
```
### Resection Status? 

```{r}
df_yes$resection_extent <- factor(df_yes$resection_extent, levels = c("Biopsy", "Resection NOS", "Subtotal Resection", "Gross Total Resection"))
km <- survfit2(Surv(overall_survival, status == 1) ~ resection_extent, data = df_yes)

ggsurvfit(km) + 
  add_pvalue("annotation", size = 5) + 
  labs(
    x = "Time",
    title = "Overall Survival of Treated Patients by Resection Extent"
    )
```
### MGMT Summary

```{r}
mean_survival_mgmt <- df_no %>%
  group_by(MGMT_methylation) %>%
  summarise(mean_survival = mean(overall_survival, na.rm = TRUE))
colnames(mean_survival_mgmt) <- c("MGMT Status", "Mean Overall Survival")
mean_survival_mgmt %>% gt()


table(df_no$MGMT_methylation)
```

### Is there a difference in overall survival for MGMT unmethylated and methylated status patients who received the Stupp protocol? 

```{r}
df_stupps <- df_yes %>% filter(received_stupp == "yes")

km <- survfit2(Surv(overall_survival, status == 1) ~ MGMT_methylation + received_stupp, data = df_yes)
ggsurvfit(km) + 
  add_pvalue("annotation", size = 5) + 
  labs(
    x = "Time",
    title = "Overall Survival of Patients Treated by MGMT Status + Stupp"
    )
```


```{r}
df_yes$stupps_mgmt <- interaction(df_yes$received_stupp, df_yes$MGMT_methylation)

fit <- survfit(Surv(overall_survival, status == 1) ~ stupps_mgmt, data = df_yes)
medians <- surv_median(fit)

medians_df <- data.frame(group = names(summary(fit)$table[, "median"]),
                         median_survival = summary(fit)$table[, "median"])

medians_df <- medians_df %>%
  separate(group, into = c("received_stupp", "mgmt_status"), sep = "\\.") %>%
  mutate(received_stupp = sub(".*=", "", received_stupp))  

colnames(medians_df) <- c("Received Stupps?", "MGMT Status", "Median Survival (Months)")

medians_df %>% gt()
```

We see that Stupps + Methylated Status = longest median survival time. Kruskal-Wallis test to test for significance.

```{r}

### Median Age Analysis

```{r}
median_age <- summary(df_yes$diagnosis_age)

df_yes$median_age_status <- cut(df_yes$diagnosis_age,
                    breaks = c(0, 65, 100),  
                    labels = c("Below Median", "Above Median"),  
                    right = FALSE)

km_median_age <- survfit2(Surv(overall_survival, status == 1) ~ median_age_status, data = df_yes)
ggsurvfit(km_median_age) + 
  add_pvalue("annotation", size = 5) + 
  labs(
    x = "Time",
    title = "Overall Survival of Groups Above and Below Median Age of Treated Patients"
    )
```

We see significance here, what about for dividing dataset into thirds?

```{r}
df_yes$age_thirds <- cut(df_yes$diagnosis_age, 
                     breaks = c(0, 52, 72, 100), 
                     labels = c("31-51", "52-71", "72-91"), 
                     right = FALSE)

km_median_age <- survfit2(Surv(overall_survival, status == 1) ~ age_thirds, data = df_yes)
ggsurvfit(km_median_age) + 
  add_pvalue("annotation", size = 5) + 
  labs(
    x = "Time",
    title = "Overall Survival of Age Groups (Thirds)"
    )
```

And fourths? 

```{r}
df_yes$age_fourths <- cut(df_yes$diagnosis_age, 
                     breaks = c(0, 46, 61, 77, 100), 
                     labels = c("31-45", "46-60", "61-76", "77-91"), 
                     right = FALSE)

df_yes$age_young <- cut(df_yes$diagnosis_age, 
                     breaks = c(0, 46, 100), 
                     labels = c("31-45", "46-91"), 
                     right = FALSE)

km_median_age <- survfit2(Surv(overall_survival, status == 1) ~ age_fourths, data = df_yes)
ggsurvfit(km_median_age) + 
  add_pvalue("annotation", size = 5) + 
  labs(
    x = "Time",
    title = "Overall Survival of Treated Patients by Age Groups (Fourths)"
    )

km_young <- survfit2(Surv(overall_survival, status == 1) ~ age_young, data = df_yes)
ggsurvfit(km_young) +

```

### Is temozolomide associated with longer survival?

```{r}
km <- survfit2(Surv(overall_survival, status == 1) ~ num_chemo, data = df_yes)
ggsurvfit(km) + 
  add_pvalue("annotation", size = 5) + 
  labs(
    x = "Time",
    title = "Overall Survival of Patients by Number of Chemotherapy Cycles"
    )
```

Temozolomide makes a huge difference in overall survival. We can see that patients that received three or more cycles had the longest survival times. Below is a summary table of each chemo group. 

```{r}
chemo_freq <- data.frame(table(df_yes$num_chemo))
colnames(chemo_freq) <- c("Number of Chemo Cycles", "Count")
chemo_freq$`Percentage of Patients` <- round(((chemo_freq$Count)/(sum(chemo_freq$Count))*100), 2)

df_chemo <- df_yes %>% filter(!is.na(num_chemo)) %>% filter(!is.na(overall_survival))

mean_survival_chemo <- df_chemo %>%
  group_by(num_chemo) %>%
  summarise(mean_survival = mean(overall_survival))

colnames(mean_survival_chemo) <- c("Number of Chemo Cycles", "Mean Overall Survival")


chemo_stats <- merge(chemo_freq, mean_survival_chemo, by = "Number of Chemo Cycles", all = TRUE)
chemo_stats %>% arrange(`Number of Chemo Cycles`) %>% gt()

broom::tidy(kruskal.test(overall_survival ~ num_chemo, data = df_chemo))
```

### Is radiation associated with longer survival time?

```{r}
df_yes$num_radiations <- factor(df_yes$num_radiations, levels = c("0", "<1", "1", "<2", "2", "â‰¥3"))
km <- survfit2(Surv(overall_survival, status == 1) ~ num_radiations, data = df_yes)
ggsurvfit(km) + 
  add_pvalue("annotation", size = 5) + 
  labs(
    x = "Time",
    title = "Overall Survival of Patients by Number of Radiation Cycles"
    )
```

```{r}
rad_freq <- data.frame(table(df_yes$num_radiations))
colnames(rad_freq) <- c("Number of Radiation Cycles", "Count")
rad_freq$`Percentage of Patients` <- round(((rad_freq$Count)/(sum(rad_freq$Count))*100), 2)

df_rad <- df_yes %>% filter(!is.na(num_radiations)) %>% filter(!is.na(overall_survival))

mean_survival_rad <- df_rad %>%
  group_by(num_radiations) %>%
  summarise(mean_survival = mean(overall_survival))

colnames(mean_survival_rad) <- c("Number of Radiation Cycles", "Mean Overall Survival")

rad_stats <- merge(rad_freq, mean_survival_rad, by = "Number of Radiation Cycles", all = TRUE)
rad_stats %>% arrange(`Number of Radiation Cycles`) %>% gt()

broom::tidy(kruskal.test(overall_survival ~ num_radiations, data = df_rad))
```

### Mitotic Activity vs Ki67 Correlation 

KM Curve for the categorical parts of the mitotic activity increase. 

```{r}
# KM curve for mitotic activity 
micat_df <- df_yes %>% filter(mitotic_activity_increase %in% c("0", "1to5", "6to10", ">10"))
micat_df$mitotic_activity_increase <- factor(micat_df$mitotic_activity_increase, levels = c("0", "1to5", "6to10", ">10"))

mai_count <- data.frame(table(micat_df$mitotic_activity_increase))
colnames(mai_count) <- c("Mitotic Index", "Count")
mai_count %>% gt()
```

Looking at Kaplan-Meier survival curves 

```{r}
micat_df_nz <- df_yes %>% filter(mitotic_activity_increase %in% c("1to5", "6to10", ">10"))
micat_df_nz$mitotic_activity_increase <- factor(micat_df_nz$mitotic_activity_increase, levels = c("1to5", "6to10", ">10"))

mai_km <- survfit2(Surv(overall_survival, status == 1) ~ mitotic_activity_increase, data = micat_df)
ggsurvfit(mai_km) + 
  add_pvalue("annotation", size = 5) + 
  labs(
    x = "Time",
    title = "Overall Survival by Mitotic Index Category"
    )

mai_km <- survfit2(Surv(overall_survival, status == 1) ~ mitotic_activity_increase, data = micat_df_nz)
ggsurvfit(mai_km) + 
  add_pvalue("annotation", size = 5) + 
  labs(
    x = "Time",
    title = "Overall Survival by Mitotic Index (Excluding 0)"
    )

mai_km <- survfit2(Surv(overall_survival, status == 1) ~ Ki67_LI, data = micat_df_nz)
ggsurvfit(mai_km) + 
  add_pvalue("annotation", size = 5) + 
  labs(
    x = "Time",
    title = "Overall Survival by Ki67 Proliferation Index Category"
    )
```

Looking specific at Ki67 and overall survival

```{r}
ki_freq <- data.frame(table(df_yes$Ki67_LI))
colnames(ki_freq) <- c("Ki67 Status", "Count")
ki_freq$`Percentage of Patients` <- round(((ki_freq$Count)/(sum(ki_freq$Count))*100), 2)

df_ki <- df_yes %>% filter(!is.na(Ki67_LI)) %>% filter(!is.na(overall_survival))

mean_survival_ki <- df_ki %>%
  group_by(Ki67_LI) %>%
  summarise(mean_survival = mean(overall_survival))

colnames(mean_survival_ki) <- c("Ki67 Status", "Mean Overall Survival")

ki_stats <- merge(ki_freq, mean_survival_ki, by = "Ki67 Status", all = TRUE)
ki_stats %>% arrange(`Ki67 Status`) %>% gt()
```

High vs Low Ki67 + Overall Survival

```{r}
#hl_ki <- df_yes %>% filter(Ki67_level == "high" | Ki67_level == "low")
#km <- survfit2(Surv(overall_survival, status == 1) ~ Ki67_level, data = hl_ki)
#ggsurvfit(km) +

#  labs(
#    x = "Time",
#    title = "Overall Survival by High (>50%) vs Low (â‰¤10%) Ki67 Index"
#    )
```
 
 
Ki67 and Age
 
```{r}
#km <- survfit2(Surv(overall_survival, status == 1) ~ Ki67_level + age_thirds, data = df_yes)
#ggsurvfit(km) + 
#  add_pvalue("annotation", size = 5) + 
#  labs(
#    x = "Time",
#    title = "Overall Survival by Ki67 Level & Age"
#    )
``` 

Association Between Ki67 and Mitotic

```{r}
df_num_mitotic <- df_yes %>% filter(mitotic_activity_increase %in% c("0", "1to5", "6to10", ">10"))
ki67 <- df_num_mitotic$Ki67_LI
mitotic <- df_num_mitotic$mitotic_activity_increase

table_ki67_mitotic <- table(df_num_mitotic$Ki67_LI, df_num_mitotic$mitotic_activity_increase)
fisher.test(table_ki67_mitotic)
```


##### Looking at specific values of mitotic activity & Ki67
