### Project Summary

The project is an institutional review through Georgetown MedStar's Neuro-Oncology clinic. We have approximately 300 glioblastoma patients diagnosed between 2021 and 2024. \

In 2021, the WHO updated their classification for glioblastomas which prompted a need for updated research. This study uniquely includes "pure" glioblastomas. Therefore, our goal is to learn as much as we can about the disease under the new classifications.
